```

## Creating an Application and Library

```bash
# To create a new NestJS application, use the following command:
$ pnpm generate:app {your-app}

# To create a new NestJS library, use the following command:
$ pnpm generate:lib {your-lib}
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
$ pnpm start:dev {app-name}
